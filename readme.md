# Step 7 (classic)

Step 7 functions and function blocks I have used and am still using in my projects. The AWL files can simply be compiled via Step 7.

As of June 2020, this collection is in a state of flux as I am starting to add existing source code.

In your project's source folder, create a new STL source file. Paste the source code. Ensuring that the block number to be created is to your liking. Save and compile. It is possible you'll see warnngs regarding the use of AR2, but that is not a problem; we're careful.
