This works with the MicroMaster 420, 440, as well as the Sinamics G120. It may work with other drives, but I have not tested that. This FB has been serving me well for over 19 years. Use entirely at your own risk.

Please note: this FB only reads/writes from parameter pages 1 (0-1999) and 2 (2000-3999).
