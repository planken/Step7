This works with the MicroMaster 420, 440, as well as the Sinamics G120. It may work with other drives, but I have not tested that. This FB has been serving me well for over 19 years. Use entirely at your own risk.

**Notes**

* This FB only reads/writes from parameter pages 1 (0-1999) and 2 (2000-3999).

* Version 3 and up: control word 1 (STW1) bits 13 and 14 (motorized potentiometer up/down) are repurposed for Drive Data Set selection.
